            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Will comply with your deſires, in giving you a view of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Affairs,</hi> and before I make particular Anſwers to your Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will lay open the whole matter of Fact which hath occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Meeting of Eſtates, in their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Acceptance of the Crown, and the Inſtructions given by His <hi>Majeſty</hi> to his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner for holding of the Parliament, that you may be the better able to make a Judgment how far His <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath made Conceſſions to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Minds, and eaſe the Grievances of that Nation, by his Offers in his Inſtructions, to quite Voluntarily theſe Advantages which the Crown hath inſenſibly got over the People ever ſince the Union of the two Kingdoms, whereby <hi>Scotland</hi> is as much in the Power and Mercy of their Kings, as moſt of the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> by a Legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the Conſent of the People in Parliament.</p>
            <p>It may be then Surpriſing if this great Opportunity hath not been Imbraced, and theſe offered Conceſſions turned into perpetual Laws. But the Ambition of ſome, and the Selfiſh-Deſigns of others hath Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the Happineſs which that Nation could only expect from this Revolution, and have kept it under the Power of theſe ſevere Laws and ſtretched Prerogatives which His <hi>Majeſty</hi> was willing to have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable number of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> did attend His <hi>Majeſty</hi> in his Expedition for <hi>Britain,</hi> and many moe having Met him at <hi>London,</hi> they did Addreſs to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to Aſſume the Government, till the Meeting of the Eſtates, which they deſired him to Call. The Procedure in that Meeting was with a great deal of Diſcretion and Diſpatch, till the Country was put in a poſture of Defence againſt an Invaſion they had reaſon to apprehend from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and till the Inſtrument of Government was finiſhed, which is almoſt in the ſame terms with that of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Eleventh day of <hi>April</hi> laſt, the Eſtates did Proclaim their <hi>Majeſties</hi> King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with all the Joy and ſincerity that could be Expreſt, the ſame day their <hi>Majeſties</hi> were Crowned in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Eighteenth day of the ſaid Month the Eſtates did proceed to the Conſideration of ſome Grievances to be Repreſented to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> which they humbly deſired might be Redreſſed to his <hi>Majeſties</hi> firſt Parliament. The Inſtrument of Government doth contain what
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95656:4"/> the Eſtates did Aſſert to be the Peoples Right, and the ſeveral Facts condeſcended upon are declared Illegal, and the higheſt Violations of Law, for which the Throne was declared Vacant. The Grievances do acknowledge the things complained upon to be Legal, but that the Laws introducing or allowing them are grievous, and therefore there was neceſſity of applying to the King for Reſcinding and taking off theſe Laws.</p>
            <p>Upon the Twenty Fourth of <hi>April,</hi> all the Grievances were conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and three Commiſſioners, being one for each Eſtate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, were diſpatched with the offer of the Crown to their <hi>Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Eleventh of <hi>May,</hi> the Commiſſioners did preſent a Letter from the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which was Read firſt, then the Inſtrument of Government, then the Grievances, and laſt a Deſire from the Eſtates to be turned into a Parliament. The King Anſwered the Commiſſioners in theſe Terms. <hi>When I engaged in this undertaking, I had particular Regard and Conſideration for</hi> Scotland, <hi>and therefore I did Emit a Declaration for that, as well as to this Kingdom, which I intend to make good and effectual to them. I take it very kindly that</hi> Scotland <hi>hath expreſt ſo much Confidence in Me, and Affection to Me; They ſhall find Me willing to Aſſiſt Them in every thing that concerns the VVell and Intereſt of that Kingdom, by making what Laws ſhall be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Security of their Religion, Property and Liberty, and to eaſe them of what may be juſtly grievous to Them.</hi> Then Their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> took the Coronation Oath, and within ſome few days the King declared his Pleaſure for turning the Meeting of Eſtates into a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their own deſire, and he did Nominate the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> his Commiſſioner, and upon the Thirty One day of <hi>May,</hi> His <hi>Majeſty</hi> did Sign his Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Upon Their Majeſties acceptance of the Crown, all Commiſſions, Gifts, and other Writs Superſcribed by the King, muſt of neceſſity be Docueted and Counter-ſigned by His Secretary of State; The King made choice of my Lord <hi>Melvil</hi> for that Office, a perſon who could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be induced to act in the Publick, during the former Reigns, who had been Forefault, and forced to abandon his Relations, and Native Countrey, and flee to <hi>Holland,</hi> where, and in <hi>Germany,</hi> he remained ſeven years; of whoſe Integrity and Sufficiency the King had good proof abroad, and of his ſincere Inclinations for the Intereſt of Religion, and His Majeſties Undertaking! It was likewiſe neceſſary for His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to have an Advocat, and He did name Sir <hi>John Dalrymple,</hi> one of the three Commiſſioners which the States had ſo much recommended, and conſidered, as to Signalize and Intruſt Them with a Matter of the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95656:4"/> higheſt Credit and Reputation, as the offer of the Crown, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coronation Oath; The reſt of the Offices His Majeſty did not ſupply, that He might have more opportunity to know who were Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, and Deſerving Perſons for theſe Imployments. Hitherto Matters were Managed with Calmneſs and Concord; But now when the other Offices of Honour and Profit began to be Diſpoſed on, many who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did pretend to be behind with none for their Zeal, in their King and Countreys Service, they quickly forgot the ſenſe of their Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that Duty and Gratitude they owe to their Deliverer. It had been moved in the Grand Committee of the Meeting of the Eſtates, that it might be ſpecially Provided in the <hi>Inſtrument of Government,</hi> That the King ſhould not have Power to Name the Judges, Privy Counſellors, or Officers of State, but with Conſent of Parliament; This Motion was univerſally Rejected, and thrown out with Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as an unreaſonable Incroachment upon the Monarchy; and there were only three in that whole Meeting, who did favour the Propoſal, of whom, ſome have worthily Retrited themſelves, by owning the Kings Right in this Point, when it was afterwards called in queſtion; but what was univerſally Conſidered as an intolerable Invaſion on the Royalty, when there was no Government, hath been ſince owned for Law, and a Matter of the higheſt Importance; this alteration of ſome mens Sentiments, fell out Critically at that period, when the King came to diſpoſe of the Honourable, or Advantagious Poſts of the State, then every man began to value himſelf, and to believe he was better Judge of his own fitneſs for theſe Offices than the King, whoſe Right it is to Diſpoſe on them; and thus our pleaſant Scene is turned into Confuſion, and ſome who doubted of their Intereſt to be preferred by their Princes Favour to that Share and Intereſt in the Government they deſigned, they run about, hoping to force Him to take them off, for fear of their miſchief, whoſe Actings ſhew they reſolve rather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb that Peace which is not yet well Confirmed, to Embroyle the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Shake the Throne, Hazard Religion, and all to a Revolution, than fall ſhort of their pretenſions; as if they had ſaid, <hi>Flectere ſi ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queo ſuperos acheronta movebo;</hi> and they have endeavoured to Amuſe the unwary multitude, with the ſpecious Pretexts of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and that their Grievances are ſo far from being Redreſſed, that there are new Invaſions made upon them, and ſo inſtead of taking their Relief, which the King hath offered to all the Grievances repreſented by the Eſtates; they fall upon new Complaints, not formerly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, nor thought juſt, or worthy to be inſiſted on, for which ſome have Addreſt to the King with great peremptorineſs, hindring their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95656:5"/> Native Countrey from receiving the benefit of the Conceſſions, which His Majeſty offers in His Inſtructions. But that I may not ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon you in this matter, I will fairly ſet down both the <hi>Grievances,</hi> and the <hi>Redreſs</hi> offered by His Majeſty, in the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> to His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, with ſome ſhort Notes, that you may better underſtand the nature of the <hi>Grievances,</hi> and the Fulneſs of the <hi>Relief</hi> that is offered by the <hi>Inſtructions;</hi> and in regard the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> contain moe things than the <hi>Grievances</hi> do, ſuch as the turning the States into a Parliament, and the like, they do not follow the ſame Method, or Anſwer the number; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall repeat every Article of the <hi>Grievances,</hi> with the particular <hi>Inſtruction</hi> relating to it together, and then come to your Queſtions.</p>

            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> doth conſiſt of three Eſtates, who all meet in one Houſe, and by the antient Laws and Cuſtom of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, there was a ſelect number of Perſons Choſen out of the Three Eſtates, who with the Officers of State, were called, <hi>Dominiad Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culos,</hi> becauſe they did prepare Articles, or Propoſals, and Framed Acts, which were brought in to be Conſidered in Parliament; And this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for Articles hath been as Antient as we find any Records of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in that Kingdom; and the Officers of State were always Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The great Weight in the Mannagement of Affairs, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to this Committee: And in Antient times, after the Articles were once Conſtitute, the Parliament did Adjourn to a certain day, till
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95656:5"/> all things were prepared by the Articles, which were to be propoſed in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Policy of that Kingdom had introduced, and maintained this Conſtitution of the Articles, upon weighty and ſolid Reaſons, as 1<hi rend="sup">o.</hi> To preſerve the different Intereſts of the Three Eſtates among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the ſeveral Eſtates having no <hi>Negatives</hi> in the Parliament; for though one State were intirely oppoſite, the plurality of the whole doth Determine and Decide; And the Eſtates not being equal in number, a greater State Combining, might overthrow the Intereſt of another, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince the State of the Nobility being increaſed at the Kings Pleaſure, there are at preſent as many Lords in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as do equal, or exceed the number of the Commiſſioners for Shires and Burrows to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: As alſo, the number of the Royal Borrows may be increaſed at the King's Pleaſure; But the Shires remaining the ſame, the Eſtate of the Burrows, which hath the greateſt part of the Property; and viſible Eſtate of the Nation, they may have the feweſt Votes in the Parliament: But in the Articles, every State hath an equal number, whereby in the Projecting, and Framing of the Laws, each State hath an equal Intereſt. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. All the Eſtates meeting in one Houſe, and there being no <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> a ſuddain Vote would put the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> to this ſtrait and difficulty, either to conſent to a Law, whereof they might be ignorant as to its Deſign and Framing, or elſe to refuſe the Royal Aſſent, and ſo a Breach or Difference were Stated betwixt the King and People, and there could be nothing more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for preventing theſe Inconveniences, than the Chooſing of a ſelect number for each Eſtate, who with the Officers of State for the King, did Prepare, Digeſt, and Adjuſt all Matters which were to be brought in to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> there are two Houſes, and their Forms of Proceeding are ſlow and Cautious, whereby the King may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand whatever is under the Deliberation of the one Houſe, before it come to the other, and by Conference betwixt the two Houſes, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters uſe to be Adjuſted before they come the Kings length for the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſent: But in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Procedure is quick, and the Forms of Parliament are Expedit and Summar; beſides the Temper and Genious of the Nation, which is ready, (not to ſay, <hi>Praefervidum Scotorum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genium</hi>) whereby Matters of the greateſt Importance may be Stated, and Determined at one Sitting in the Parliament of <hi>Scotland;</hi> And therefore as Matters in <hi>England</hi> do proceed by Bills from the Houſes to the King; ſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Buſineſs did Commence from the Articles, in which, both the King and People had their ſhares of Members.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95656:6"/>
            <p>Of late there hath Exceſſes and Abuſes crept in to the Articles, both as to the manner of their Conſtitution, and Power of Prelimiting the Parliament. And ſince the Year 1633. The Biſhops did chuſe Eight Noblemen, and the Noblemen did chuſe Eight Biſhops, theſe did chuſe Eight of the Commiſſioners for Shires, and Eight of the Commiſſioners for Burrows, who with the Officers of State, made up the Articles; by this method, both the ſmall Barons and Burrows were excluded from any Intereſt in chuſing the Articles, and they had not ſo much as a Vote in chuſing theſe perſons who were to Repreſent their particular Eſtates in the Articles. And it being the King's Prerogative to name all the Biſhops, in effect the King had the ſole Power, or Influence to make the whole Articles. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Inſtead of a Preparatory Committee for Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things that were to be brought to Parliament, the Articles did aſſume a Power, that what they once rejected, could not be brought in to plain Parliament: But yet by the expreſs Act of Parliament fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the 1. <hi>Act, Seſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Parl.</hi> 1. K. <hi>Charl.</hi> 2. The Articles is Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in the manner above-mentioned, to be a perpetual Law in all time coming, which was juſtly repreſented as a <hi>Grievance</hi> to the King; but there is not the leaſt mention of Officers of State, though that point was ſpoken of, and under Conſideration in the Meeting: by this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> the King did moſt Graciouſly and Fully Redreſs theſe Errors and Corruptions of the Articles, by allowing every State to chooſe its own Repreſentatives, and Declaring that the Articles ſhall not have Power to Pre-limit the Parliament, but that even theſe things that have been rejected in the Articles, may be brought in, in plain Parliament, whereby the intereſt of the Eſtates are equal and intire, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can never be impoſed upon, nor precluded.</p>
            <p>It might have been expected, that ſo Gracious a Conceſſion from the King, and His parting with ſo important a Jewel, ſhould have ſatisfied every man, that the King deſigned no Arbitrary Power, and that He verified that Clauſe of His Letter to the Eſtates, <hi>That he would never put His Greatneſs, or the Advantage the Crown had got, in the Ballance with the True Intereſt of the Nation;</hi> Yet this Conceſſion did not pleaſe, but ſome men inſiſted, <hi>That there ſhould be no Articles, or conſtant Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee at all;</hi> having now taken up a prejudice againſt the Name, as well as the Exceſs of the Thing, though the <hi>Grievance</hi> calls it the Articles, and mentions not one word againſt a conſtant Committee; But now they would make an Inference from the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> though the Conſtitution of the two Parliaments are totally different. And next, they did Object againſt the Officers of State, though this was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment, or Corruption, but they were Members of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95656:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the moſt Ancient Conſtitutions; And theſe laſt hundred and fifty years, the Officers of State are named together in a Column by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as diſtinct ſupernumerary Perſons for the Intereſt of the Crown; and as the Officers of State are not mentioned in the <hi>Grievance,</hi> ſo the meaning of the Articles cannot be extended to reach them, for they being Supernumerary, and for the King, are not to be choſen, nor can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any State of the Parliament, becauſe they are Members of Parliament, as Officers of State, and are called and ranked, though they be but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, before the Commiſſioners for Shires and Burrows.</p>
            <p>It cannot but appear a great Extremity, that whereas by the preſent ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law, the King hath the whole Power and Influence in making the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that in an inſtant, He ſhall be reduced to have no Intereſt at all; and whereas every Eſtate hath an equal ſhare of Members in this Committee for preparing Things to the Parliament, the King ſhall have none for Him; and every Body knows what Advantage may be made in the Framing and Wording of an Act where the Matter may be plauſible, and it were hard that the firſt Notice or Advertiſement the King or His Commiſſioner might have of a Law deſigned, were to hear it Read and Voted in the Houſe, and ſo be put on a ſudden to give His Conſent, or interpoſe His Negative after the Parliament has engaged themſelves by a Vote, this Rock Our Anceſtors have alwaies ſhunned: and there never was a Vote in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Scotland</hi> before this time, till the Matter was firſt ſubjected to the King's Conſideration, and that His Commiſſioner was previouſly Inſtructed, or knew it to be agreeable to the King's Inclinations: And there being a Law ſtanding, that all Matters to be determined in Parliament, muſt be firſt brought into the Articles, till that Law be Repealed, at leaſt theſe Votes which were preſſed in the Addreſs were both unneceſſary and prepoſterous. But the King was ſo far from taking any occaſion of Diſpleaſure, that he did Conced a further ſtep by an Additional Inſtruction, Dated at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> the Fourth day of <hi>July</hi> laſt, which the Commiſſioner Read in Parliament.</p>

            <p>The Depredations by the <hi>Highlanders</hi> is certainly a great inconvenience to the Kingdom, whereby the Inhabitants to the Low Lands are not only obliged to keep numbers of armed Men to watch and guard the Paſſages and Deſcents from the <hi>Highlands;</hi> but likewiſe to pay conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Compoſitions to theſe Robbers, to procure their Protection and Aſſurance, which the Law diſcharges, and this Acknowledgment is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Black-mail, whereby theſe Thieves are ſuſtained without Induſtry or Vertue, who are hard to be reduced or brought to Juſtice, becauſe of the unacceſſableneſs of the Mountains, and that Forces are not able to find Subſiſtance there, nor march as far in two or three days in a Body, as the <hi>Highlanders</hi> can do in one; and therefore the Grievance is juſt.

The Royal Burrows make up the Third Eſtate to the Parliament; and each Royal Burrow doth ſend One Commiſſioner but <hi>Edinburgh</hi> which ſendeth Two to Repreſent in Parliament, the Lands given out by the King to their reſpective Burrows, to be holden of him Burgage, whereby <hi>unaquaeque Gleba,</hi> every Bit of the Kingdom is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament: But the Number of the Lords being Increaſed at the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95656:14"/> King's pleaſure, they are now become as many as the Commiſſioners of Shires and Burrows, if they were all preſent, and it hath been the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of our Kings to Erect Royal Burrows, as they think fit, the Shires always remaining the ſame. The Commiſſioners for Shires, who do repreſent the greateſt part of the Property of the Nation, they are not proportional in Number, and they have made many Attempts, that the Shires being unequal in Extent, Value, or Number of Inhabitants, that therefore the great Shires might be allowed to ſend more Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which is agreeable to the Act of Parliament, to ſend two or more, that the Repreſentation in Parliament of the Nation might be the more equal. This Deſign hath been always obſtructed by the Lords, or great Barons, that they might have more Votes and Influence in the Parliament; as alſo, the Court hath conſidered the Barons, as that part of the Parliament, wich could be leaſt pack'd or influenced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons generally of the beſt Senſe and Subſtance, as being choſen by the reſt of the Barons to repreſent them: Therefore the Court hath never favoured this adjuſting of the Repreſentations, having greater Influence upon the Royal Burrows, who are weaker, and upon the Noblemen, who are generally more neceſſitous, and ſo more eaſily brought over to the Sentiments and Deſigns of the Court. But this King regarding Equity and Juſtice more than Power, he hath conſented that the Repreſentation in Parliament be rendred as equal as can be, and that the greater Shires ſhall have a greater Number of Repreſentatives.</p>

                  <p>YOu are to paſs an Act, Ratifying the Priviledges of the Burrows, and Securing their Rights, in Electing their own Magiſtrates for the future, and that the Burrows of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>St. Andrews</hi> ſhall have the Electing of their own Provoſts, Baillies, and Town-Council, as the other Royal Burrows of that Kingdom have.</p>

            <p>The Royal Burrows have a peculiar Intereſt in the King, for as Burghs of Barony and Regality, are Incorporations belonging to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, ſo the Royal Burrows are in a particular manner the King's own Burrows, holding immediately and directly of the King; and the Law doth not allow the interpoſition of any Nobleman,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95656:15"/> or Baron, to have intereſt in the Magiſtracy of Burrows, but only ſuch as are of their own Community: Of late, the Royal Burrows were extreamly incroached upon; and in the laſt Reigns, the Magiſtrates of Burghs were nominat by Letters from the King, though by their Charters, the Incorporation, and Town-Council had Right to chuſe their own Magiſtrates. His Majeſty, then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration for <hi>Scotland,</hi> takes ſpecial notice of the Injury done to the Royal Burrows; and therefore, though the Grievance in relation to the Purrows, be altogether general, yet His Majeſty hails an opportunity to redreſs and gratifie them; and therefore he impowers his Commiſſioner to make a Law, Ratifying all their Priviledges, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Commiſſioner was obliged to give the Royal Aſſent to any thing that the Parliament ſhould determine to be the Right and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Burrows. 2. His Majeſty offers to ſecure to the Burrows, that they ſhall never be invaded for the future, and that they ſhall have the ſole and free Choice of their own Magiſtrates. 3. By the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of Epiſcopacy, the King being come in the place of the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> he had in their Right, the Power of naming the Provoſt and Magiſtrates of theſe Burghs, whereby <hi>Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow,</hi> though it be the ſecond Burgh in the Kingdom, yet it hath not the ordinary Priviledges of the meaneſt Burgh-Royal; and the King, to ſignifie his Gracious Intentions to the Burrows in general, he gives them all that is in his Power, and allows theſe two Burrows to chuſe their own Magiſtrates; albeit ſome have repreſented this Conceſſion to be prejudicial to the Crown, and that it is fit for the Crown, that the King retain in his own hand, the chuſing of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> as an Awe-band over that numerous people, or that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Power to ſome great Family about them, who may keep that City in order. 4. Trade being the great concern of the Burrows, the King hath allowed his Commiſſioner to paſs Acts, one, or more, what the Parliament ſhall think fit for the Encouragement of Trade, which give a ſufficient Riſe and Warrant for Repairing the Royal Burrows, againſt any Invaſions that had been made upon their Rights in the point of Trade; ſo that they ſhould not be obliged to pay for a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they did not enjoy: Here is a notable Evidence, how far the moſt gracious Conceſſions of a Prince may be miſtaken and ſlighted. The Royal Burrows were abuſed by the Induſtry of ſome perſons, and made believe, that the King by his Inſtructions, had given them no Relief, and that he had not regarded the Grievance, in relation to the Royal Burrows, upon this Impoſture they did combine in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95656:15"/> to refuſe a Supply, to oppoſe any thing, that was brought in, in purſuance of the King's Inſtructions, and to concur in all the Votes that was brought in againſt him, which they did accordingly, only a few Burgeſſes being excepted; and certainly, if they had underſtood the King's Gracious Intentions towards them, they could never have been guilty of ſuch Tranſports againſt both their Duty and their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and when they come to be informed, it will oblige them for the future to be more cautious, not to take up an ill Report, raſhly to doubt their Soveraign, or deſtroy themſelves; and the Royal Burrows being further ſham'd to ſend up theſe ſame perſons who had abuſed them with an Addreſs to His Majeſty, deſiring an Anſwer to that Grievance which did concern them: His Majeſty pitying their Innocence, gave an Anſwer in Writing, that it might be ſure to come to their Hands, ſignifying, <q rend="inline">That he had remembred their Concerns very particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginning, and that they had no reaſon to doubt his Care, deſired them not to ſuffer themſelves to be further abuſed, to miſtake their own Intereſt, but that they might believe he would redreſs all the juſt Grievances of the Nation, and ſpecially of the Royal Burrows, in whom he owned a peculiar Intereſt.</q> This Goodneſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance in the King, cannot fail to produce ſuitable effects of Duty and Gratitude, and when the Burrows ſhall be ſufficiently informed, they will certainly take occaſion to have a new Convention, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his Majeſty an humble acknowledgment of their miſtakes, and a dutiful ſenſe of his Favours, as well as the Conceſſions in his Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Now you ſee that the King hath given a particular Gracious Anſwer to every one of the Grievances; and beſides theſe, there is an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Regulation of the Univerſities: And after all, the King concludes with a general Inſtruction, <q rend="inline">If there be any thing elſe that may be neceſſary for the good of that Kingdom, to be paſt into Laws: You are to acquaint Us from time to time, with ſuch Overtures, that you may be Authoriſed with particular Inſtructions thereanent.</q> This admits no Paraphraſe, it was impoſſible for a Prince to ſay more, this was a <hi>Catholicon</hi> for curing all the Grievances, that either were, or could be repreſented; and what a ſtrange Return was it, not to tranſmit their Overtures, but to proceed to Votes, ſtraiten and manacle the Royal Authority, in its moſt neceſſary and undoubted Powers.</p>
            <p>Since I have given you the Grievances and Inſtructions together, you are able to Judge, and I do ſubmit to your Judgment, whether my Reflections be Genuine or no; and I ſhall conclude: That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies under the preſſure of moſt heavy and grievous Laws. 2. The
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95656:16"/> King hath done all upon his part that was poſſible, to render that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happy; and ſince he muſt be acquitted by all indifferent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I will not give myſelf the trouble to tell you who are guilty, ſince the Inſtructions are ſo full, the Miniſters of State muſt be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>By this time, I think you may be able to reſolve your own Queſtions. 1. If the King hath done his part, and be not to blame, how comes the Majority of the Parliament to be diſcontented? 2. Why did not the Parliament accept theſe Conceſſions <hi>pro tanto,</hi> and turn them into Laws, and then ask what more they thought neceſſary? 3. What is the meaning of ſo many Addreſſes, and particularly, the laſt which is Printed? 4. Upon what grounds does theſe men build their hopes, who do ſo pertinaciouſly oppoſe the King, and what may be expected, whether the Presbyterians will joyn with them or not?</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, your Doubts are highly reaſonable, but they may be Reſolved, by what hath been already clearly ſtated, and what I ſhall further tell you; great expectation is a mighty enemy to Contentment, if there were leſs ſelfiſhneſs amongſt us, there would be more Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; people did expect the return of the Golden Age, or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Thouſand Years from this Revolution, and their Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is like to hinder them to enjoy what they deſire. The King can imploy no more Actors than our Stage can hold: He hath not put any Stranger, nor any <hi>Scotch-man</hi> that ſerved him abroad in any <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Imployment; if the Nation could make a larger Fond, no doubt he would be willing to entertain more perſons, for it's not likely the King intends to put up any <hi>Scots</hi>-Money in his Pocket at preſent, he hath allowed no multiplication of Offices in one perſon, but by putting the great and lucrative Offices into Commiſſions, there are twice as many perſons imployed in this Government, as ever can be inſtanced in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p>In the whole Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for all this Noiſe, there are not twenty perſons, as I do verily believe, who are at bottom ill affected to their Majeſties Service, and Government, but there are very many who have been ſeduced, and have been impoſed upon, wholly under groſs miſtakes, which have tranſported them beyond the bounds of Diſcretion or Duty.</p>
            <p>There are perſons amongſt us, who have their thoughts ſo much ſet upon getting into the Government, and Lucrative Places of the Kingdom, that they are reſolved to diſquiet the Government, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content the people, before they fail of their pretenſions, and they turn
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95656:16"/> themſelves into all ſhapes, and ply every Wind to Deceive, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe the people; their influence is not ſo much becauſe they are able and leading Men, as that they are reſtleſs and implacable Spirits; and they have gotten this aſcendent over a great part of the Parliament, two or three ways: 1. The moſt part of the Parliament have been kept ignorant of the King's Inſtructions; and there was no Artifice wanting, to poſſeſs every State and Perſon, that the King had refuſed Satisfaction, or Redreſs to theſe points of the Grievances which were moſt material; and I know, to my experience, that the Miniſters, and alſo ſeveral Members of Parliament, who came up here with the loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Complaints, upon a ſight of His Majeſty's Inſtructions, they were furpriſed and convinced: and the like ſucceſs may be expected throughout the whole Kingdom and Parliament, after a competent time to be informed, and peruſe the Inſtructions, and that they may return to their former temper, and ſhew that affection they had for his Majeſty, and the deference and ſubmiſſion to his Management of Affairs. 2. Theſe perſons who are ſo inſatiable for preferments and places, they did very dexterouſly ſtart and manage an unneceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Whether or not the King was obliged by their Offer, and his Acceptance of the Crown, to Redreſs all Grievances; and whatever Concluſions they were pleaſed to draw from them, as their meaning, though theſe be neither obvious nor expreſt: and albeit it be very true, that the Grievances are not obligator upon the King as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, further than the King in his wiſdom ſhall find the things complained upon, to be truly prejudicial to the Nation, and in ſo far as Father of the Country, he is obliged to give his people relief; but their Majeſties were declared, recogniſed, and proclaimed King and Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi> before the Grievances were framed, and ſo they could be no Condition or Quality of their Right, but being humbly repreſented to the King's Majeſty from the Eſtates, to be redreſſed by him in Parliament; his Majeſty did not at all engage himſelf in any particular, but declared in general, That he would Redreſs every thing that was truly grievous to the Nation: Now while they manage this diſingenious and weak Argument, Whether the King be obliged to Redreſs the Grievances, they in the mean time have endeavoured to perſwade the people, that the King hath not at all done it, and that he is ſo far from performance, that both he and his Miniſters denies there lies any obligation upon him, ſo that in this Revolution, the people do only obſerve a change of Maſters, but no eaſe of Burden, or Redreſs of Laws: now after the publiſhing of the Inſtructions, this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95656:17"/> Impoſture is ſo groſs and palpable, that it can no longer detain the people in ignorance. 3. When the Parliament was willing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the Inſtructions, and to have ſetled their Church-Government; theſe perſons brought in always ſome new Motions, which they did pretend to be neceſſarily previous; as firſt, they did pretend the Articles was a preliminary; and therefore nothing could be done till that point was adjuſted: Next they did inſinuate, that it was to no purpoſe to ſettle the Church till firſt the State was purged, and all the ill Men rendered incapable; for if ill Men were permitted to come in to the Government, they might eaſily turn the Settlement of the Church round; and thereupon there was a great ſtruggle and debate, Whether Church-Government ſhould be firſt ſettled, or the State purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Act of Incapacities, brought in by the Earl of <hi>Mortoun;</hi> and it was carried, The Church Government ſhould be delayed and poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned to the purging the State; which may demonſtrat, that theſe Men had more the State than the Church under their proſpect: Thereafter the ſettling of Church-Government being brought in, they ſtarted a freſh Hare, and managed a Debate with great earneſtneſs, that their Commiſſioners had not done their Duty in the offering of the Crown, according to their Commiſſion and Inſtructions; and it was a ſecond time brought to the Vote, Whether Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Exoneration of the Commiſſioners ſhould firſt come in. It was carried again, to delay Church-Government; and ſeveral days being ſpent upon that matter, it came to nothing, and was found to be peſtered on groundleſs Malice: Thereafter the Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was talked of; and then it was pretended that ſo long as the Act of Parliament ſtood unrepealed anent the Articles, nothing could come in legally to the Parliament, but from the Articles: hereupon the King was pleaſed to make a further ſtep, and he ſent down new Inſtructions, which the Commiſſioner did intimat in plain Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, bearing his Majeſty's Conſent, that Church-Government might be ſettled, Fines and Foreſaultures conſidered by the Parliament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Committees, or without Committees, as the Parliament pleaſed; and in ſo far as concerns theſe points, the King did paſs from his Right, and conſented that his Officers of State ſhould have no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling in the matter, but remitted theſe matters intirely to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and this Conceſſion being publickly intimat from the Throne, it was openly aſſerted by Lawers and others, that albeit the King did paſs from the Articles, as to theſe points by an expreſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to his Commiſſioner, yet the Settlement could not be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95656:17"/> till either the Articles were repealed, or a draught brought in to the Articles. Here I ſhall intreat you to obſerve when theſe Men had no mind to bring in a matter, then the Articles was ſo indiſpenſable, that the King's Inſtructions was not ſufficient to warrant the legality of any matter to be brought into Parliament, otherways than from the Articles; but when ever they reſolved to have a matter brought in, then there was neither neceſſity nor uſe of the Articles, but they durſt adventure to proceed in all theſe Votes contained in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, without ever acquainting the King, or procuring an Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Commiſſioner, or Tabling theſe matters before the Articles, which they would never allow to be choſen, according to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law: By this you may gueſs at the Ingenuity of their Procedure, and if it were not tedious, I could give you many ſuch Inſtances; The Eſtates did apply to the King to be turned into a Parliament, that no time might be loſt by the Indiction of the Parliament; the King had no ſooner granted it, but a Committee of the Eſtates did Addreſs to him to delay the Diet of the Parliament, till ſome of them might come up (which was to ſecure their Intereſt in getting Offices and Places in the State) which took off the reaſon they had preſſed to be turned into a Parliament, rather than that a new one ſhould be called. Likewiſe that Committee did take upon them to give good Injunctions to the King, not to be haſty in diſpoſing of Places, till his Majeſty might take Information from ſome perſons whom they did recommend: And accordingly his Majeſty did neither at that time, nor till now, diſpoſe of any place, but what was abſolutely neceſſary: And in the nomination of the Lords of Seſſion, the King did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the whole number, but only Ten to make a full <hi>Quorum,</hi> which might do all buſineſs while he were further informed for naming the other Five. This was no ſooner done then it was quarrelled as a Nullity in the Nomination, becauſe it was not compleat. The King by three ſeveral Inſtructions preſſed the ſettling of the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and did allow it to be done in any way they pleaſed, with Committees, or without them: And ſicklike, for conſidering Fines and Forefaultures; which was as oft ſhifted by thoſe perſons who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the Addreſs, and at laſt it was declared to be impracticable; and yet they have the confidence to ſpend a great deal of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, complaining for the not ſettling of Presbyterian Government, and reſtoring Fines and Forefaultures, as if the fault had lyen upon the King, and that he needed to be puſht to it, whereas they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95656:18"/> have been the only Obſtructers. And I am credibly informed, that while they run about to amuſe every body, they tell thoſe who are of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ingratiat with them, that what they did in relation to the aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy, was nothing of their own inclinations, but to comply with the King's Inſtructions, who was engaged in that matter before he came from <hi>Holland,</hi> which is ſufficiently confuted by the Inſtructions themſelves.</p>
            <p>As to your ſecond Queſtion, you have great reaſon to wonder why a Prince having made ſo great Conceſſions, they were not accepted by every body, and that it had been a better ſeaſon afterwards to have demanded more. But the miſery lyes here, if once the Inſtructions had been underſtood, and been reduced into Laws, that muſt have given ſo univerſal a ſatisfaction to the people, and procured ſo much affection and gratitude to the King, that all the Addreſſes, Hopes and Endeavours had been in vain to creat Jealouſie, and maintain Faction and Mutiny: For the benefits and eaſe the Nation ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, would have been ſo ſenſible and freſh, that the Whiſperer or Backbiter would have found no place or admittance; whereas now the Nation remaining under its Fetters, there being nothing done for its advantage or ſatisfaction; every body is ſenſible of the miſery it feels, but few can make a Judgment of the Cauſe and the Author, and they have been eaſily impoſed upon to believe, that theſe who keep them in Slavery, are the Champions, and that he who promiſed, and from whom they expected Relief, hath deſerted them: And to make theſe ſurmiſes paſs the more plauſible, they give it out that the King is peſtered with ill Counſellors, and that the Malignants, and theſe who ruined the Nation formerly, are to be aſſumed into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they may act their former part, or a worſe over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; whereas almoſt all the Places and Commiſſions are filled with perſons as have either never been in the Government, or have acted moſt inoffenſively there.</p>
            <p>As to your third Queſtion, there came three Addreſſes to the King, one from the Clergy, deſiring their Church Government to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; I am confident upon the ſight of the Inſtructions, and their application to the King, the Miniſters were convinced and ſatisfied that the King had done all that was proper for him, and that it was their intereſt and duty to ſtand firm by the King, and that their Party had no hopes or ſecurity under God, but in him.</p>
            <p>There was another Addreſs from the Burrows, deſiring the King
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95656:18"/> to give Inſtructions in relation to their Grievance; I cannot ſay that their Commiſſioners were ſatisfied, becauſe they were men choſen out, and ſent up here upon another deſign than to take ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and therefore they got their Anſwer in Writing; but I hope the Burrows do already, or ſhall ſhortly underſtand how they were abuſed: Thus far they did only choiſe a Traſequing Burgeſs, who might be concerned in the intereſt of that State, next day they were Whidled to choiſe the two Lawers, whoſe errand was none of their buſineſs, and yet they were to bear their Charges.</p>
            <p>There was a third Addreſs from a great many of the Members of Parliament, I need not tell you what undue practices was uſed to procure and mendicat Subſcriptions, after the Parliament was up, and to very little purpoſe; for except it had been to inſult the King, as they have done in all the ſteps of their management. Could an Addreſs out of Parliament import more than a Vote of Parliament? except it were to convince the King of their peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs, and that they were incorrigible, and that nothing was to be expected from the Parliament, when it ſhould meet again, tho I do not believe that the King needs to fear this; for when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Parliament comes to be informed, and ſhall ſee the Inſtructions, they will perceive clearly the ſelfiſh and implacable deſigns of ſome men, and their falſe ſurmizes, that they will quit and fall off from theſe men, and leave them to themſelves, to double out their pretenſions for places, in which the Countrey hath little concern. I need not tell you the matter of the Addreſs, ſince it is Printed; I ſhall make ſome ſhort reflections upon it. 1. Theſe Votes which were ſo unſeaſonably brought in, and ſo peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſed, have no relation to the Grievances. Now if they had been of ſo great importance, why were they then forgot? And if they be of leſs importance than the Grievance, why do they make ſuch a buſtle to preſs in theſe points of leſs moment, and ſtop theſe things which are of far greater conſideration, which were firſt Tabled by a repreſentation from the States, and granted by the Kings Inſtructions? And its pretty odd to ſee men who make ſuch
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95656:19"/> a noiſe about the Authority of the Grievances, that the King muſt ſatisfie them, and yet when they pleaſe to bring in any little Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it muſt take place, and juſtle out the other. 2. As to the Vote of Incapacities, it is indeed a Vote incapacitating the King to imploy any perſon in his ſervice but whom they pleaſe; for the Terms are ſo lax, and the Nation ſo univerſally invovled, that there are few men of Buſineſs, Fortune, or parts, but they may be reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moſt part of the Addreſſes themſelves, as far as they are capable they are guilty; but when a man turns upon that ſide, the moſt abominable and monſtrous faults are covered, whereas trifles are muſtered and magnified, if a man be on the Kings ſide. And I cannot forget the laſt Member of the incapacities, <hi>that all who have obstructed the deſigns of the Houſe, after they came the length of Votes, ſhall be incapable of Publick Trust,</hi> though the Royal conſent neither is, nor I believe will perhaps ever be adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited; ſo they are no Laws, but abortive Attempts, which never had a precedent, and it may be will never have a parallel. 3. As to that Article concerning the Seſſion, I have already told you how it was thrown out by the Committee of the Eſtates. I dare ſay to you upon my reputation, that there is not one word in our Law giving the Parliament any power in Tryal or Admiſſion of the Lords of Seſſion. I ſhall refer you to two ſhort Acts in <hi>Anno</hi> 1661, the ſecond and eleventh Acts of the firſt Seſſion, firſt Parliament K. <hi>Ch.</hi> 2d. Where the King's Right in this point is as clearly ſtated, as can be expreſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Acts are as follows,</p>
            <floatingText xml:lang="eng" type="act">
               <body>
                  <head>ACT and Acknowledgment of His Majeſties Prerogative, in the choiſe of His Officers of State, Counſellors and Judges.</head>
                  <p>THE Eſtates of Parliament conſidering the great obligations that do ly upon them from the Law of God, the Law of Nations, the Municipal Laws of the Land, and their Oaths of Allegiance, to maintain and defend the Sovereign Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95656:19"/> of the Kings Majeſty, and the ſad conſequences that do accompany any incroachments upon, or diminutions thereof; do therefore from their ſence of duty, declare, that it is an inherent priviledge of the Crown, and an undoubted part of the Royal Prerogative of the Kings of this Realm, to have the ſole choice and appointment of the Officers of State, and Privy Counſellors and nomination of the Lords of Seſſion, as in former times, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the year 1637. And that the Kings Sacred Majeſty, and his Heirs and Succeſſors, are for ever, by vertue of that Royal Power, which they hold from God Almighty over this Kingdom, to enjoy and have the full exerciſe of that Right: And therefore the Kings Majeſty, with Advice and Conſent of his Eſtates of Parliament, doth hereby reſcind all Acts, Statutes, or Practices to the contrair.</p>

            <p>I ſhall only tell you, that the Seſſion is ſitten down with as great ſatisfaction as ever it did, and ſeveral of the moſt eminent Lawyers have accepted, whoſe Practice was much better than their Sallaries; and you muſt allow me to ſay, ſince they muſt know the Law, they are great fools if they be not ſafe: And I am ſure the greateſt Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that did oppoſe this, would have been content to have run the hazard of the Parliaments cenſure, if they could but procured the Kings Commiſſion, and would have parted with the Club to the Boot, when they had got their own Staik. And as to that part of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95656:20"/> the Vote, that the Preſident ſhould be choſen by the Lords, this did not concern the Parliament, ſince the Lords did not complain: And the five laſt ſucceſſive Preſidents are named by the King in the ſame manner: Beſides, my Lord <hi>Stairs</hi> is not made of new Preſident, but reſtored to an Office whereunto He had been formerly Admitted by the Lords, conform to the Kings Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, from which he was unjuſtly thruſt out: And withal, the Lords did unanimouſly by a Vote acquieſce in His Majeſties nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and reponing the Preſident, and declared, if the matter had been intire to themſelves, they would all and every one of them have choſen him; ſo this duſt has been very idly raiſed. 4. I muſt again take notice of that grief they expreſs for the want of that Church-government they themſelves hindered to be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the deſign of the Addreſs is to Imprint in the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the people, that the King is ſlow or backward in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 5. As to the Apology for not giving Ceſs, it is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, they did not refuſe it abſolutely, but till ſome things were firſt exped which might give them ſatisfaction; that is to ſay, they would give no Ceſs or Subſiſtence for the Kings Troops, though they muſt quit the Countrey if he withdraw them, till ſuch time as the King ſhall renounce the remainder of his Soveraignty: And I ſhall not ſay that he hath been prodigal of his Prerogative, but I am ſure he hath been ſo liberal of it, that it might at this time have given contentment for once. It is needleſs in this caſe to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either the obligations we owe to our King, or the neceſſity we have of his Protection; but I ſhall offer two things to ſhow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and fooliſhneſs of refuſing this Supply. 1. The King hath expended above threeſcore thouſand pounds upon his Troops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of his own Pocket, for our defence, and in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms, Ordnance and Ammunition thither; and if he ſhould abandon us this Winter, the beſt part of the Nation would be forced to leave the Countrey. 2. By a ſtanding Law, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſettled Eight Months Ceſs upon King <hi>James,</hi> during his life time, which we payed pleaſantly, for ſupporting that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was it diſcretion to refuſe the King four Months Ceſs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95656:20"/> which is but 24000 Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> which he was willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, inſtead of demanding the Eight Months during King <hi>James</hi>'s life? And ſuppoſing that he had redeemed us from that Eight Months Ceſs, as well as many other miſeries, was it grateful or juſt to grudge him one years Ceſs, for the relief of the reſt? There was more heat in this matter than conſideration. 6. I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their confidence, in pretending to be ſurpriſed with the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Adjournment of the Parliament; moſt men did wonder it ſat ſo long, and every body knew it was to riſe that Week; that ſtrange Vote in refuſing four Months Supply after all the reſt that had paſſed, made it evident there was no better to be expected; and when they had formerly refuſed to proceed upon the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how could any man think that they ſhould not be Adjourned?</p>
            <p>As to your laſt Queſtion, where theſe mens ſtrength lyes, and whether the Presbyterians will deſert the King, and joyn with them? I tell you plainly my thoughts, theſe men play upon the Presbyterian Staik; and though the Sticklers be perſons who have little concern in Religion, or regard to Church-government, and when Epiſcopacy was formerly aboliſhed, and all the Laws eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing it Reſcinded, in conſequence the Laws made at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in favours of the Presbyterian Government, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dintegrat and revived; the ſame might now have been done, but thirſame Addreſſers did oppoſe it, and did add a Clauſe in the Houſe, declaring the Church-government was yet to be eſtabliſhed, upon this project, that if Presbytery were once eſtabliſhed, they knew the Presbyterians needed no more depend upon them; whereas the Presbyterians muſt either ſupport them, or elſe they will turn about and fall in with the Cavaleer Party againſt them: for they Front to all Sides but to the King, and in the mean time they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Presbyterians jealous of the King, and tell them that the Civil Magiſtrate likes always to have the Church in his power, and that the King to oblige the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will in the end a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandom them, whereas they are willing to eſtabliſh Presbytery in what terms they can deſire, and to go the length of a Covenant and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95656:21"/> League with the Diſſenters in <hi>England.</hi> But after all, I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that the Presbyterians will be ſo impoſed upon, and whidled out of their Intereſt, by perſons they know to have no concern for Religion, but to raiſe themſelves by it: And therefore I think the following Conſiderations will ſecure the Presbyterians. <hi>Firſt,</hi> All the Presbyterian Lords in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have been all along of that Perſwaſion, and have ſuffered for it, have all to a Man ſtood firm to the King in this Parliament, againſt the Club, and they are almoſt all actually imployed in His Service. Now it is not poſſible that any rational or ſober Presbyterian will part with their old and great Friends, who are able to do them good, for new Undertakers, whereof ſome have been lately their Perſecutors, and the Presbyterians have no ſafe retreat, King <hi>James</hi> will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt, nor forgive them. Will they be Neuters, and Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at again, as the Five Weſtern Shires did in <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. when they refuſed to joyn either with King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Army, or <hi>Cromwels:</hi> This deſign was both fooliſh and fatal, they were quickly broken at <hi>Hamiltoun. Secondly,</hi> I can hardly believe that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians will forget the regard the King had to their ſufferings, that he hath revived and reſtored them, and will certainly ſettle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> by Presbyters, and imploy them where they are capable, in the Civil Government, if they themſelves do not hinder him. For though I do not believe that the King either is, or ſhould be of a Party, yet their circumſtances lyes together, his ſucceſs, and their deliverance. For in <hi>Scotland,</hi> though we had Biſhops who were Tools for the Civil Government, and led Horſes for the State, yet we never admitted Canons, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or any Forms in our Church; ſo that even in time of Biſhops the Nation was Presbyterian: And whereas the Church and Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> before this Revolution, were ſtanding in the Gap, and ſuffering; and the King in His Speech to the Parliament, did avouch them to be a Bulwark to the Proteſtant Religion, yet at that time our Biſhops in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their Addreſs to King <hi>James,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for his ſucceſs and proſperity in that Expedition, but they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95656:21"/> pray that God may give him the necks of his Enemies, after they knew that the King, then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Embarqued, and had ſet Sail for <hi>Britain.</hi> This may conciliate a greater confidence and regard from the King to the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland,</hi> without giving any diſcouragement or diſpleaſure to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> For a Prince that hath different Countries and Nations, may maintain diſtinct Religions, and much more diſtinct Forms of Government, profeſſing the ſame Religion, without affecting or neglecting any man upon that account. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it is duty and gratitude for the Presbyterians to ſtand firm by the King, they lye under a ſuſpition to be difficile and uneaſie under any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that their Principles are more ſuited to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth than Monarchy; they have now an opportunity to retrive and vindicate themſelves from theſe aſperſions; and if they be ſuch fools as to ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced to quit the King for the Club, there are many that are now looking after their halting, who will not be wanting to repreſent to the King, that he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected a far greater intereſt, in looking after the Diſſenters, whom he could not manage. Theſe and other ſuch Conſiderations will certainly oblige the Presbyterians to look to their intereſt, and foreſee their danger, if they ſhould either lye by, or prove unkind: And if they do not ſupport and ſuſtain this Club, it will fall to nothing, and the Nation will return to ſome better temper, and ſee their folly, in not cloſing with the Kings Inſtructions. Sir, I have been carried far beyond my deſign, in giving you an account of my thoughts in this matter. But without further, I am,</p>
